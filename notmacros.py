AVG()

algorithm:
#"preprocessing" just means we need to turn input into pure algebraic expression before formally parsing
breakdown(){

    #convert the input code into an eqn representing it
    #important flag keywords: AVG, SQRT, SQR, SDEV, VAR, etc.
    #return the main eqn as a string, then the flags as one string, then the sub eqns

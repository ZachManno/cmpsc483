- Macro expansion is quirky

Big Z Question: Ans = x * y but this isn't a real problem! Ruh roh! Scooby snacks?
JD: We have just arithmatic statements atm.

Shaffer: Good start! There's plenty of work to be done. Just work on the straight equations for now (later address Macros.)

Rodney thought: Honestly think that this should be handled immediately. Substantial refactor would be required imo otherwise

Shaffer:
A lot of this isn't defined, but flags sound like a really good approach.
Make final equation made up of smaller equations. <---- This is obvious but very important. Everyone should understand this.
Special case processing doesn't work.
Something about tildes. Ole?
No reason to try to do this outside of a tree.

Big Z with the last question:
I have an idea of a constant, some problems have these (F to C conversion such as 9/5)

Little Lasky with the clarification: User wants to define constants

Shaffer: Sounds good.

Stephen comes back with a great XCOM 2 reference, followed by a funny black box comic from Shaffer.

Stephen follows up with a clutch binoculars example to really convey how we all feel, and then presses on with
making Shaffer feel bad about an inside joke that doesn't exist.

Shaffer continues the discussion with marriage advice on the engineering mindset. Code refuse.


God Stephens trolling is relentless.
Shaffer now thinks I'm emotional and JD gave up a promising acting career for college.


Do plenty of research (Ontology). Another mindspin followed by an inevitable dig from Stephen about my Heart Rate Monitor

Shaffer "I thought you were giving it to me." RIP Rodney 2017

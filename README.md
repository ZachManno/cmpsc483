## *PSU CMPSC 483 - CSE Department - Generating Natural Language Specifications from Computer Code*


The ultimate goal of this project is to develop natural language expressions (word problems) from mathematic equations. Â 

Example: 
<code>a + b</code>     =>     <code>There are a apples and b bananas. How much fruit is there?</code>

### Installation

1. Pull the code from github. 
2. Install [Inflect](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/inflect "Inflect Documentation"). 
   - Mac: <code>sudo -H pip install -e git+https://github.com/pwdyson/inflect.py#egg=inflect</code>
   - Windows: <code>pip install -e git+https://github.com/pwdyson/inflect.py#egg=inflect</code>

### Sample Program 
A sample execution program is available in <code>program_sample.py</code> '

Run the program. The system will prompt you to input variables and what they equate to. Be sure to include one line to be the answer. 
 
Sample Input: 
- <code>a = 1 + 2</code>
- <code>b = x + 5</code>
- <code>ANS = a * b</code>

We also support a few **macros**, including: 
- AVG[] (Average of all values pased in) 
   - <code>AVG[X, Y, Z] </code>
- SQR[] (Square of the one value passed in) 
   - <code>SQR[x]</code>
- RAND[] (Pick a random number between 0 and the value passed in. 
   - <code>RAND[100]</code>

Follow the prompts to finish your equation input. The system will then prompt you for the number of equations you would like to see generated. Proceed to see your output!

### Use of Program
This system will be primarily used in an academic setting, although applications of this development could potentially extend beyond this setting.
There has already been extensive research and development regarding the translation of natural language to computer code, but very little for the reverse.
For programming assignments, professors often write word problems for the students to write the corresponding code.
However, writing multiple word problems is tedious, and students often google search the word problems to easily find the answers.
The end goal of the project was to make the creation of word problems out of equations streamlined, where each input could produce a variety of different problems.

### Ideas for Future
This project is still in its infant stages, however there are many exciting possible improvements/additions to the system including:
- Including support for conditional if/else statements
- A full application with an intuitive GUI to allow students to have infinite practice
- Machine learning to improve the quality of problems
